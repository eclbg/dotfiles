I've started using [goku](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo), which translates a much
easier to write language to the karabiner config in json. The goku file has .edn extension and has
to be placed in ~/.config/karabiner.edn for goku to pick it up. This is a major quality of life
improvement to writing those awful json files
