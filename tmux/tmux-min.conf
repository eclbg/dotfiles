### TMUX minimal config by eclbg

# Place it in ~/.tmux.conf or ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf

# This is a slightly opinionated config with the basic stuff that makes tmux
# usable for me I don't have many more changes in the config I use. But I do
# use a couple plugins that I manage with tpm (tmux plugin manager).
# My full config is in https://github.com/eclbg/dotfiles/blob/main/tmux/tmux.conf

set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"

# ctrl + space as prefix. The default is ctrl-b which sucks. Some people use ctrl-a
unbind-key C-b
set-option -g prefix C-Space
bind-key C-Space send-prefix

# Enable mouse support. I don't use this but it definitely makes sense to get
# started.
# You can do everything you would do on a terminal with the mouse as you get
# used to tmux:
#  - right click on the session name (bottom left of the status bar, between `[]`) 
#    for session commands
#  - right click on the window name (next to the session, preceded with 0: or 1:)
#    for window commands
#  - right click anywhere on a pane (one of the splits) for split commands
# Then, when you start wanting to learn the key combos, press prefix + ? to see a list
set -g mouse on

# Open new windows in the current pane directory
bind '"' split-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind % split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind c new-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"

# session picker using fzf in a pop up with prefix + g
# It's really nice
# This requires fzf installed. On MacOS, just run brew install fzf
bind g display-popup -E "\
    tmux list-sessions -F '#{?session_attached,,#{session_name}}' |\
    sed '/^$/d' |\
    fzf --reverse --header jump-to-session --preview 'tmux capture-pane -pt {}'  |\
    xargs tmux switch-client -t"



# This is to move between panes with ctrl + hjkl (vim movement keys)
# There's 2 blocks here, you should only leave one uncommented

# Block 1
# If you don't use vim, or you don't use ctrl + hjkl to move between vim/nvim splits, use this block:
bind-key -n 'C-h' select-pane -L  # -L means left
bind-key -n 'C-j' select-pane -D  # -D means down
bind-key -n 'C-k' select-pane -U  # -U means up
bind-key -n 'C-l' select-pane -R  # -R means right

# Block 2
# Otherwise, your tmux and vim commands clash. I use this block to detect whether the current pane is a vim one or not, and act accordingly.
# You'll need to do something similar in vim, so it forwards the keymap to tmux if you're at a split that's on the edge. 
# I use the Navigator plugin in nvim to achieve this. Just add it to the plugins list in Lazy and it works without additional config.
# "numToStr/Navigator.nvim"
# is_vim="ps -o state= -o comm= -t '#{pane_tty}' \
#     | grep -iqE '^[^TXZ ]+ +(\\S+\\/)?g?(view|l?n?vim?x?)(diff)?$'"
# bind-key -n 'C-h' if-shell "$is_vim" { send-keys C-h } { if-shell "$is_mosh" { send-keys C-h } { if-shell -F '#{pane_at_left}'   {} { select-pane -L } } }
# bind-key -n 'C-j' if-shell "$is_vim" { send-keys C-j } { if-shell "$is_mosh" { send-keys C-j } { if-shell -F '#{pane_at_bottom}' {} { select-pane -D } } }
# bind-key -n 'C-k' if-shell "$is_vim" { send-keys C-k } { if-shell "$is_mosh" { send-keys C-k } { if-shell -F '#{pane_at_top}'    {} { select-pane -U } } }
# bind-key -n 'C-l' if-shell "$is_vim" { send-keys C-l } { if-shell "$is_mosh" { send-keys C-l } { if-shell -F '#{pane_at_right}'  {} { select-pane -R } } }



# VI Copy mode. I don't know how the other one works. This allows you to use usual vim commands like ctrl-u/d, word 
# jumps, f/t, etc. I catch myself using pageup pagedn too.
# Press space to start a selection and Enter to copy it
# Use ctrl-v to select a block instead of full lines
set-window-option -g mode-keys vi

# Do not exit copy mode after pressing Enter to copy (default is copy-selection-and-cancel)
bind-key    -T copy-mode-vi Enter                send-keys -X copy-selection

# To move to other panes in copy mode with the same ctrl + hjkl as usual
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'C-h' if-shell -F '#{pane_at_left}'   {} { select-pane -L }
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'C-j' if-shell -F '#{pane_at_bottom}' {} { select-pane -D }
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'C-k' if-shell -F '#{pane_at_top}'    {} { select-pane -U }
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'C-l' if-shell -F '#{pane_at_right}'  {} { select-pane -R }

# Make pane lines thicker. Helps me spot the active pane more easily
