# Karabiner config

## Generate config - DEPRECATED

`generate_config.py` generates a complete config using `base-config.json` as a starting point.
It writes the full config in the `full-config.json` file, that has to be copied to
`~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json`

`generate_config.py` takes care of adding complex modifications to the base config, as they
can be very tedious to write manually and it's easy to make mistakes.

This has been deprecated as I'm not using any of the additional modifications since the Moonlander
